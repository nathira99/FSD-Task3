#  Memory Game Task


**Task Description:**

Develop a Memory Game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. This game should  be created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation) for game logic.


**Task Requirements:**

- Create a basic HTML layout with a container for the game board.
- Include a header with the game title and a restart button.-
- Implement the game logic to handle card flipping. When a card is clicked, it should flip to reveal the front face.
- Implement a shuffle function to randomize the card positions at the start of the game.
- Track the state of the game (e.g., which cards have been flipped, which pairs have been found).
- Implement the logic to check for matching pairs. If two cards match, they should remain face-up. If they do not match, they should flip back after a short delay.
- Add a restart function that resets the game board and shuffles the cards.
- Clean, well-documented code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- A brief README file explaining the project, how to set it up, and how to play the game.
